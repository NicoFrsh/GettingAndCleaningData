# GettingAndCleaningData
In this repo I took the raw data from "Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013. " and turned it to a tidy data set by merging all the relevant tables and cleaning the resulting data.

This repo consists of the following files:

-- the raw data used for the analysis in UCI HAR Dataset
-- the CodeBook.md file which explains all the variables contained in the resulting tidy data set
-- the Rproj file
-- the run_analysis.R script where the raw data is transformed to the tidy data
